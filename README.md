# VHSFilter
A ffmpeg VHS filter command slammed into a bash file and named as a program. (I found It on Itch.io in .bat form and 'translated' It to bash)
# HOW TO USE
To use this get the video you want the filter over, and name in INPUT.mp4, place It in the same direcotry as VHS.sh, than open terminal in the said directory and run `bash VHS.sh`, after a short bit, the program will be done, and you'll be left with a OUTPUT.mp4 file.
